// What is a Histogram Problem?
// In algorithmic terms, a histogram problem typically refers to:

// Finding the largest rectangular area that can be formed in a histogram (bar chart), where each bar has width = 1 and varying heights.

// Each bar represents a value, and you're asked:

// What's the largest area of a rectangle you can make by selecting consecutive bars?

// üìê Problem Statement: Largest Rectangle in Histogram
// Given an array of bar heights, find the area of the largest rectangle that fits inside the histogram.

// üß† Why is it important in algorithm design?
// ‚úÖ Applications:
// Area optimization:

// UI layout rendering

// Optimal resource allocation

// Packing algorithms

// 2D matrix problems:

// Used in solving Maximum Area of a 1‚Äôs Rectangle in a Binary Matrix.

// Converts each row into a histogram!

// Stack-based Algorithms:

// Teaches use of monotonic stacks for nearest smaller/greater problems.

// Fundamental in problems involving range queries, span, stock price analysis, etc.

// Sliding window + stack hybrid strategies.
