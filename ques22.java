// Time and Space Complexities:
// ğŸ”¹ Time Complexity: O(1)
// The solution only involves a couple of bitwise operations, which take constant time.

// ğŸ”¹ Space Complexity: O(1)

// Algorithm (Bit Manipulation):
// Property of powers of two:

// A power of two in binary has only one bit set to 1.

// The expression n & (n - 1) turns off the rightmost 1 bit.

// If n is a power of two, n & (n - 1) should equal 0, because only one bit is set in n.

// Condition:

// For a number n to be a power of two, it must satisfy:

// n > 0 (because 0 and negative numbers aren't powers of two)

// n & (n - 1) == 0 (only one bit is set)
