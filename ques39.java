// 1. Subsets:
// A subset of a set is a collection of elements that are selected from the original set. Subsets do not require the elements to be in any particular order, and subsets can be of any size, from an empty set to the entire set.

// Key Properties:
// Order doesn't matter: The order in which elements are selected does not affect the subset.

// Size of subset can vary: A subset can have fewer elements than the original set (including the empty set).

// Example:
// For the set {1, 2, 3}, the possible subsets are:

// {} (empty subset)

// {1}

// {2}

// {3}

// {1, 2}

// {1, 3}

// {2, 3}

// {1, 2, 3} (the set itself)

// 2. Permutations:
// A permutation is an arrangement of elements in a specific order. Unlike subsets, permutations always consider the order of elements. A permutation of a set refers to all possible ways the elements can be arranged.

// Key Properties:
// Order matters: The order in which elements are arranged is important.

// Size of permutation is fixed: A permutation always includes all elements of the set, and the number of permutations for n elements is n! (factorial).

// Example:
// For the set {1, 2, 3}, the possible permutations are:

// {1, 2, 3}

// {1, 3, 2}

// {2, 1, 3}

// {2, 3, 1}

// {3, 1, 2}

// {3, 2, 1}
